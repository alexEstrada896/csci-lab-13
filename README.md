1. (5 pts) Write a complete program in C++ that works as a Random Number Guessing Game. Your program should generate a random integer number (between 1 and 10 inclusive), and prompt the user to guess what the number is.

If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display something like:

Too high, try again.
If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display

Too low, try again.
Your program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number. Your program should also keep a count of the number of guesses the user makes. When the user correctly guesses the random number, the program should display the number of guesses. Input validation is not required for this program.

Sample output on a correct guess:

Congratulations! Your guess is correct! The number was 8.
You guessed 5 times in total.

2. (5 pts) Write a program that first prompts the user to enter how many numbers they want to enter, then with a loop prompts the user for that many integers. After all the numbers have been entered, the program should display the largest and the smallest numbers entered. Input validation is not required for this program.

Sample input:

How many numbers do you want to enter: 5
Enter number 1: 100
Enter number 2: 80
Enter number 3: 90
Enter number 4: 101
Enter number 5: 81
Sample output:

The largest number entered: 101
The smallest number entered: 80
